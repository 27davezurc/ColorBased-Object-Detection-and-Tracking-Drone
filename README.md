# ColorBased-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-Drone
Added functionality for the Tello Drone to detect and follow objects based on their color.
The webcam and drone each have two files: a colorTest file and a followColor file. The colorTest file determines the range of HSV values of the target colored object. The followColor file demonstrates which direction the drone will fly in, depending on where it sees the target colored object on the frame.
